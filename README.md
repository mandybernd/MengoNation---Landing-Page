# MengoNation---Landing-Page

This <b>is my second project</b>, where I created a landing page for a fictional fan soccer website called <b><i>MengoNation</b></i>, dedicated to the Brazilian football team fan Flamengo.

As a self-taught developer who learned HTML and CSS through The Odin Project, this task was a great opportunity to reinforce my fundamentals and expand my knowledge. It was a challenging venture, but I enjoyed every moment in it and learned a lot about functional CSS.
